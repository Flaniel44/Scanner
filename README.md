# Scanner
Level 4 Compilers Assignment 2

Complete the grammar for the PLATYPUS programming language. I created a lexical analyzer (scanner) for this language. The scanner reads a source program from a text file and produces a stream of token representations. The scanner does not need to recognize and produce all the tokens before next phase of the compilation (the parsing) takes action. That is why, in almost all compilers, the scanner is actually a function that recognizes language tokens and produces token representations one at a time when called by the syntax analyzer (the parser).

The input to the lexical analyzer is a source program seen as a stream of characters (symbols) loaded into an input buffer. The output of each call to the Scanner is a single Token, to be requested and used, in a later assignment, by the Parser. I use a structure to represent the Token. The scanner is a mixture between transition-table driven and token driven scanner. Transition-table driven scanners are easy to implement with scanner generators. In token-driven scanner every token is processed as a separate exceptional case (exception or case driven scanners). They are difficult for modifications and maintenance (but in some cases could be faster and more efficient). My scanner takes the middle road. Transition-table driven part of my scanners is to recognize only variable identifiers (including keywords), integer literals (decimal and octal constants), and floating-point literals.
